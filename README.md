# LASC
LASC (Long short-term memory and Attention mechanism for Sequence Classification) is a supervised ML method for animal behavior classification.   
All code is written in Python. 

# Description
The workflow of implement LASC includes:   
  (a) body part tracking (Deeplabcut)  
  (b) extraction of motion features  
  (c) creation of a manually labeled dataset  
  (d) LASC model training  
  (e) behavioral sequencing  

This repository contains code for motion feature extraction, LASC model construction and compilation, visualization of behavioral sequencing data, and video processing.
